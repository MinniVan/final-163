-You should write instructions for us to run your project to reproduce your
results. Tell us which Python modules to run to get your results and anything
else we need to do to run them.

To run our project, the main module will need to run to reproduce our results. 

-If there is anything we need to do to set up your project, like install
libraries or how to download your data (if you did not submit it), give us
instructions for how to do so.

Our dataset has a .z extension. 
In order to run our project, h5py, numpy, and the math libraries will need to be installed in order to open, store, and manipulate our data. We achieved this by using the anaconda platform and typing "conda install" to install the said libraries.

-Anything else we need to know about running your project!
