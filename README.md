# final-163

Our program has three modules. One to open and process the data (process_data.py),
one that runs the program (program.py), and a script that prompts the user for 
their input (prompt_script.py) to help run the program. Additionally, in order to 
run and reproduce our results a jupyter notebook will be required.

Our dataset has a .z extension. 
In order to run our project, h5py, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and the math libraries will 
need to be installed in order to open, store, and manipulate our data. We achieved this by
using the anaconda platform and typing "conda install" to install the said libraries.
