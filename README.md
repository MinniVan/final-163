# final-163

Our program has three modules. One to open and process the data (process_data.py),
one that runs the program (program.py), and a script that prompts the user for 
their input (prompt_script.py) to help run the program. A jupyter notebook will be
also be required.  Additionally, in order to run and reproduce our results all of these 
files will need to stored and ran in the same folder, that includes the jupyter notebook. 


Our dataset has a .z extension. 
In order to run our project h5py, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and the math libraries will 
need to be installed in order to open, store, and manipulate our data. We achieved this by
using the anaconda platform and typing "conda install" to install the said libraries.
