# final-163

Our program has three modules. One to open and process the data (process_data.py),
one that runs the program (program.py), and a script that prompts the user for 
their input (prompt_script.py) to help run the program. A jupyter notebook will be
also be required.  

Additionally, in order to run and reproduce our results all of these files will 
need to stored and ran in the same folder, that includes the jupyter notebook. 

Our dataset has a .z extension. And it is a relatively large dataset therefore, 
our program will require the installation of h5py - a new library that we are
implementing as a challenge for our project. 

In addition to the h5py library, these will need to be installed:

  numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and math libraries 
  
in order to open, store, and manipulate our data.

Installing these said libraries is achieved by using the anaconda platform and typing 
"conda install" to install.

We share our original data via our google doc which contained an extremely large data set.
However, now the original file needs to be renamed to 'larger_sample.z'
